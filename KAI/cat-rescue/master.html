    <h2>Our Cats</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some more details on the cats we currently have up for adoption:
    </p>          
    <p>
      Billy and Mandy:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Billy and Mandy are siblings and would prefer to be rehomed together. They are both around five years old.    
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>        
    <p>
      Greta:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Greta is a gentle tabbycat in need of a new home after her old owner passed away. All she needs in the world is a warm lap to cuddle up on affectionately.  
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Jacob was rescued from the back of an icecream truck after seeking shelter there. He had been living rough for quite some time before that and as such takes a little while to get used to new people. Jacob would prefer being the only cat in his house.  
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfie:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Alfie was brought to the Centre after being dumped in a hedge near a busy road. This experience hasn't set him back however, this tiny black kitten is eager to play and will love you forever if you feed him.   
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
