				<h2>Our Cats</h2>

				<p>
					Here are some more details on the cats we currently have up for adoption:
				</p>
					
				<p>
					Billy and Mandy:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Billy and Mandy are siblings and would prefer to be rehomed together. They are both around five years old.		
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Greta:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Greta is a gentle tabbycat in need of a new home after her old owner passed away. All she needs in the world is a warm lap to cuddle up on affectionately.	
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					Jacob:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Jacob was rescued from the back of an icecream truck after seeking shelter there. He had been living rough for quite some time before that and as such takes a little while to get used to new people. Jacob would prefer being the only cat in his house.	
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					Alfie:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Alfie was brought to the Centre after being dumped in a hedge near a busy road. This experience hasn't set him back however, this tiny black kitten is eager to play and will love you forever if you feed him.		
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
