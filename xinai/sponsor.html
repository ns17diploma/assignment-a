		<h2>SPONSORSHIP</h2>

		<p>Sponsorship costs ?5 per year per cat</p>

		<p>A photo and known details of the chosen cat are given to the sponsor as well as our three newsletters each year.</p>

		<p>The Sponsor a Cat initiative that we launched in 2005 continues to be the main source of income for our home.  For just ?5 a year you can sponsor a cat and receive a regular update letter from Êêöour cat?as well as cards at Christmas and on your Birthday.  It is an ideal gift for someone who is unable to have their own cat.</p>

		<p>125 people renewed their sponsorship last year and 35 people became new sponsors .  The cats available for sponsor are our long term residents who we have not been able to rehome and now have become our permanent residents.</p>

		<p>Henry 14 year old male ginger cat who rules the roost</p>

		<p>Ben ?another male ?white with one ear ?not a pretty looking cat but with a great personality</p>

		<p>Bonny (tabby female) and Clyde (tabby female) who are sisters</p> 

		<p>Blackie ?black and white female</p>

		<p>Sparkles ?black and white male</p>
