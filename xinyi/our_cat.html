			Our Cats<br>

			Here are some more details on the cats we currently have up for adoption:<br>

			Billy and Mandy:<br>
			Billy and Mandy are siblings and would prefer to be rehomed together. They are both around five years old.<br>

			Greta:<br>
			Greta is a gentle tabbycat in need of a new home after her old owner passed away.<br>All she needs in the world is a warm lap to cuddle up on affectionately.

			Jacob:<br>
			Jacob was rescued from the back of an icecream truck after seeking shelter there.<br> He had been living rough for quite some time before that<br> and as such takes a little while to get used to new people.<br> Jacob would prefer being the only cat in his house.<br>

			Alfie:<br>
			Alfie was brought to the Centre after being dumped in a hedge near a busy road.<br>
			This experience hasn't set him back however,<br> this tiny black kitten is eager to play and will love you forever if you feed him.<br>
