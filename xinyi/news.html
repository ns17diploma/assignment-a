			News February<br>

			It is good to see the better weather appearing and the cats certainly appreciate it.<br>  We have had a quiet time over the winter but happily even some of our long tem residents have found new homes.<br>

			We held a Christmas Bazaar just before Christmas at Bentley village hall.<br>  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the volunteers who manned the many gift, games and produce stalls.<br>  Thanks as well Mr Smith from our local shop for sponsoring us by paying for the hall hire.<br>  A grand total of ?60 was raised ?which certainly helped towards the increase in vets bills that the winter usually bings.<br> 

			Hour next fund raising event is an open Day?at the Centre on Saturday 16th March.<br>  Entrance fee will be a donation of cat food!<br>  We have printed posters advertising the event.<br>  If you are able to display one in your window or elsewhere in the surrounding area,<br> please let me know and I will send you some.<br>
