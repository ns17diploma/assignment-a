			SPONSORSHIP<br>
			Sponsorship costs ?5 per year per cat<br>
			A photo and known details of the chosen cat are given to the sponsor as well as our three newsletters each year<br>
			The Sponsor a Cat initiative that we launched in 2005 continues to be the main source of income for our home.<br>  For just ?5 a year you can sponsor a cat and receive a regular update letter from our cat?<br>as well as cards at Christmas and on your Birthday.<br> It is an ideal gift for someone who is unable to have their own cat.<br>
			125 people renewed their sponsorship last year and 35 people became new sponsors .<br>  The cats available for sponsor are our long term residents who we have not been able to rehome and<br> now have become our permanent residents.<br>
			Henry 14 year old male ginger cat who rules the roost<br>
			Ben ?another male ?white with one ear ?not a pretty looking cat but with a great personality<br>
			Bonny (tabby female) and Clyde (tabby female) who are sisters<br>
			Blackie ?black and white female<br>
			Sparkles ?black and white male<br>
